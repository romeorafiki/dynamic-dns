You will need to create a JSON formatted file that contains login credentials to Cloudflare and other details as follow:
- Email Address.
- API Key - This is NOT an API Token as generated in Cloudflare, you need your Global API Key.
- Zone ID - you can find this by logging into the DNS portion of your Cloudflare account and checking the bottom right hand corner.
- DNS Record - the record that needs to be updated.
